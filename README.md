# binorbia
Search for instantaneous binary orbits in collapsing cloud simulations. Plot the resulting systems.
Currently written for python 2.7
Requires the rebound package (https://github.com/hannorein/rebound)

Basic Tutorial:

- Run the orbit search, e.g. python orbit_search_faster.py -p test_data -d test_run_0

- Analyse the orbit data, change the relevant parameters at the top of the analyse_binaries.py file and run it.
